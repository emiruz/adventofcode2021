# Advent of code 2021

The problems are solved in *functional-style* Python.
That is, Python pretending to be Haskell :-)

All code can be run like this:
```
cat input.txt | ./01.py
```
I won't use anything outside of the standard library.

Lines of Code (LoC):

$N = 10$

$\sum = 6+12+14+24+23+8+9+13+15+16 = 140$ LoC

$\mu = \frac{\sum}{N} \sim 14$ LoC

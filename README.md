# Advent of code 2021

The problems are solved in *functional-style* Python.
That is, Python pretending to be Haskell :-) They are
also solved in Scala 3.

All code can be run like this:
```
cat input.txt | ./01.py
```
or
```
cat input.txt | ./01.scala
```

I won't use anything outside of the standard libraries
for either language.
